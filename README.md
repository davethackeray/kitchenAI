# KitchenAI: Your Personalized Recipe Assistant
=============================================

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary
-------

KitchenAI is an AI-powered tool that helps users discover delicious and easy recipes based on the ingredients they already have.

## Background
----------

Most people struggle with confidence in the kitchen. And we throw away tons of food every year. Here are the main issues:

*   **Food Waste:** Minimizes food waste by suggesting recipes that use up existing ingredients.
*   **Lack of Inspiration:** Solves the "What's for dinner?" dilemma by providing tailored recipe recommendations.
*   **Recipe Overload:** Sifts through the vast online world of recipes to find those perfectly suited to the user's needs.
    
## How is it used?
---------------

1.  **Input Ingredients:** Users input their available ingredients and quantities.
2.  **AI-Powered Search:** KitchenAI's AI engine searches recipe blogs and YouTube videos for matching recipes.
3.  **Personalized Recommendations:** Users receive recipe and video recommendations tailored to their preferences, skill level, and time constraints.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Users rate the quality of the recommendations, improving future suggestions.
5.  **Profile Building:** Users share their favorite cuisines, dietary needs, and family preferences for further personalization.
6.  **Community Sharing:** Users can share their own recipes and connect with other food enthusiasts.

## Data sources and AI methods
---------------------------

*   **Data Collection:** User-provided ingredient lists, ratings, and preferences.
*   **External Sources:** Recipe blogs, YouTube videos, nutritional databases
*   **AI Methods:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand recipe content and user preferences.
    *   Recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant recipes and videos.
    *   Machine learning models to continuously improve recommendations based on user feedback.

## Challenges
----------

*   **Data Quality:** Ensuring accurate and consistent ingredient information.
*   **User Adoption:** Encouraging users to provide detailed feedback and build their profiles.
*   **Algorithm Bias:** Mitigating potential biases in the recommendation algorithm.

## What next?
----------

*   **Expanded Features:**
    *   Meal planning tools
    *   Grocery list integration
    *   Ingredient substitution suggestions
    *   Virtual cooking classes
        
*   **Enhanced AI:**
    *   Improved ingredient recognition (image analysis)
    *   Deeper personalization based on user behavior
    *   Cross-platform integration (mobile app, smart home devices)
